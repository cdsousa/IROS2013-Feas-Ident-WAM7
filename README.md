Research Notebook
-----------------

The research is done in [Python](http://www.python.org/) within an [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) (the *Paper IROS2013 - Phys Feas Dyn Param Ident 7-DOF WAM Rob.ipynb* file).
Data is in *data* folder. Additional Python support code is in *support_funcs* folder

The file *Paper IROS2013 - Phys Feas Dyn Param Ident 7-DOF WAM Rob.html* is a **preview** of the notebook. **It can be seen online at:**

Paper Correction
----------------

The published paper presents a physically feasible base parameter solution ("beta star", rightmost column of Table I) which was obtained not taking the friction parameter positiveness constraints into account, contrary to what is shown in equation (17).
In this notebook, both the paper solution (without positiveness constraints on friction parameters) and the correct solution (with positiveness constraints on friction parameters) are computed and presented (to distinguish,  variable names are suffixed with the words "paper" and "correct", respectivelly). Nevertheless, the differences between both solutions (with exception to the corrected friction parameter) are very small, arround 1%. 


How to run the code
-------------------

- clone the git repository (it contains code and data) from https://github.com/cdsousa/IROS2013-Feas-Ident-WAM7
- open the *Paper IROS2013 - Phys Feas Dyn Param Ident 7-DOF WAM Rob.ipynb* notebook with [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
- edit and run the code
